Improve room scoring and add inline palette quick-assign

- Weight harmony scoring by item visual prominence (L=3x, M=2x, S=1x)
  so changing a couch moves the score more than changing a railing
- Replace coarse bucket scoring with continuous functions for better
  sensitivity when comparing similar options
- Fix lightness scoring: stop penalizing wide range (light walls + dark
  wood is normal), only penalize gaps and uneven spacing
- Add inline palette strip for one-click color assignment to room items,
  with Browse all link to the full swatch picker
- Remove tendency dropdowns and weight badges from room item rows
  (they were not producing visible results and added UI noise)
